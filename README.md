# 📍 Smart Attendance System (Flutter + Firebase)

A secure, location-aware mobile attendance system built using **Flutter** and **Firebase**, designed to prevent proxy attendance using **GPS location** and **WiFi BSSID verification**.

This project demonstrates real-world mobile application development, backend integration, and secure attendance validation logic.

---

# 🚀 Features

* 📱 Cross-platform mobile application (Android/iOS)
* 📍 GPS-based attendance verification
* 📶 WiFi BSSID validation for network-based authentication
* 🔐 Firebase Authentication for secure login
* ☁️ Cloud Firestore database integration
* ⚡ Real-time attendance marking
* 🧾 Attendance status feedback to user
* 🏫 Designed for schools, colleges, and organizations

# 🧠 Problem It Solves

Traditional attendance systems are vulnerable to:

* Proxy attendance
* Fake location check-ins
* Unauthorized access

This system ensures attendance is marked only when the user is:

* Present at the correct GPS location
* Connected to the authorized WiFi network
